//production notes

//20/05/13
first commit from the uni mac room. installed git bash. paste=insert. 

//26/05/13
//the git version control will look a little strange up until now
//my commits weren't showing up on github, only locally through git log
// on git push attempts-slew of errors relating to permissions, not being able to find the remote and my favourite Permission denied (public key)
//finally resolved the issue- generated missing ssh key using online tutorial, added to git settings
//used git remote set-url and git push --set upstream origin master
//all local commits finally logged
